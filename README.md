## Getting Started
You can import the module by using: 

```powershell
Import-Module .\path\to\PSFolderSize.psd1
```
-or-
```powershell
Import-Module .\path\to\FolderModuleFilesAreIn
```

I will be adding it to the PowerShell Gallery after some more testing.

Once it is imported, use...

```powershell
Get-Help Get-FolderSize -Detailed 
```
...to get all the help goodness.

Check out the Examples folder for example(s) on how to use the module.

There's only one for now, with more to come!
